Q1 What is a data type?
Answer: A data type is a classification of data that determines the type of operations that can be performed on it. 
In Python, some examples of data types are integers, floats, strings, booleans, and list.


Q2 What is the difference between mutable and immutable data types?
Answer: Mutable data types can be modified after they are created, while immutable data types cannot be modified. 
For example, lists and dictionaries are mutable data types, while strings and tuples are immutable data types.


Q3 How do you convert a string to an integer in Python?
Answer: You can convert a string to an integer in Python using the int() function. 
For example, int("5") will return the integer 5.


Q4 What is the difference between a float and an integer data type? When would you use each?
Answer: An integer is a whole number, while a float is a decimal number. 
Integers is use for counting or whole-number calculations, while floats are used for more precise calculations that involve decimals.


Q5 What is an operator in Python?
Answer: An operator is a symbol or function that performs an operation on one or more values. 
Examples of operators in Python include arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (==, !=, <, >), and logical operators (and, or, not).


Q6 What is the difference between the '==' operator and the 'is' operator in Python?
Answer: The '==' operator checks if two values are equal, while the 'is' operator checks if two values refer to the same object in memory.


Q7 How do you use the 'in' operator in Python?
Answer: The 'in' operator is used to check if a value is in a sequence, such as a string or a list. 
For example, "a" in "abc" will return True.


Q8 What is the difference between the 'and' and 'or' operators in Python?
Answer: The 'and' operator returns True if both operands are True, while the 'or' operator returns True if at least one operand is True.


Q9 How do you use the 'not' operator in Python?
Answer: The 'not' operator is used to invert the value of a boolean expression. 
For example, not True will return False.


Q10 What is a conditional statement in Python?
Answer: A conditional statement is a statement that performs different actions based on whether a condition is True or False. 
An example of a conditional statement in Python is the if statement:
if x > 0:
print("x is positive")
else:
print("x is negative or zero")



Q11 How do you use the 'if', 'elif', and 'else' statements in Python?
Answer: The 'if' statement is used to test a condition, while the 'elif' statement is used to test additional conditions. 
The 'else' statement is used to perform an action if none of the conditions are True. 
For example:
if x > 0:
print("x is positive")
elif x == 0:
print("x is zero")
else:
print("x is negative")


Q12 What is the purpose of the 'pass' statement in Python?
Answer: The 'pass' statement in Python is a placeholder statement that does nothing. 
It is used when you need to have a statement in your code to satisfy the syntax requirements, but you don't want to execute any code. 
For example, 
it can be used as a placeholder when you are defining a function or a class and haven't yet written the implementation.


Q13 What is a looping statement in Python?
Answer: A looping statement in Python is a statement that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code. 
There are two types of looping statements in Python: 'for' loops and 'while' loops. 


Q14 How do you use the 'for' loop in Python?
Answer: The 'for' loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list or a string) and execute a block of code for each element in the sequence. 


Q15 How do you use the 'while' loop in Python?
Answer: The 'while' loop in Python is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. 


Q16 What is the purpose of the 'break' statement in Python?
Answer: The 'break' statement in Python is used to exit a loop prematurely. When a 'break' statement is encountered inside a loop, 
the loop is immediately terminated and the program execution continues with the next statement after the loop. 
The 'break' statement is often used in combination with conditional statements to exit a loop early if a certain condition is met.


Q17 What is the difference between the 'continue' and 'pass' statements in Python?
Answer: The 'continue' and 'pass' statements in Python are both used in loops, but they have different purposes. 
The 'continue' statement is used to skip over the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. 
The 'pass' statement is used as a placeholder when you need to have a statement in your code to satisfy the syntax requirements, but you don't want to execute any code. 
The 'pass' statement does nothing and simply allows the program to continue executing.


Q18 What is a function in Python? Can you provide an example?
Answer: A function in Python is a block of code that performs a specific task. 
It is a self-contained unit of code that can be called from other parts of a program. 
Functions help to organize code into smaller, more manageable pieces, and make it easier to reuse code.


Q19 How do you define a function in Python?
Answer: To define a function in Python, you use the 'def' keyword, followed by the name of the function and a set of parentheses. 
Inside the parentheses, you can specify any parameters that the function should take. 
The body of the function is indented and contains the code that should be executed when the function is called. 


Q20 What is the purpose of the 'return' statement in Python?
Answer: The 'return' statement in Python is used to return a value from a function. 
When a 'return' statement is encountered inside a function, the function is immediately terminated and the value specified in the 'return' statement is passed back to the calling code. 
The 'return' statement is optional, and if it is omitted, the function will not return a value.


Q21 What is a default parameter in Python?
Answer: A default parameter in Python is a parameter that has a default value specified in the function definition. 
If a value is not provided for the parameter when the function is called, the default value is used instead. 


Q22 What is the difference between a function call and a function definition in Python?
Answer: A function call in Python is when you actually invoke the function and pass in any necessary arguments. 
A function definition in Python is the code that defines what the function does and how it should be executed. 
The function definition is where you specify the name of the function, any parameters it should take, and the code that should be executed when the function is called.
When you call a function, the code inside the function definition is executed with the arguments you pass in.
